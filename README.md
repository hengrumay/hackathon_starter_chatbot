#Hackathon Starter Chatbot
This repo will have the code for agent based hackathon using langchain tools

#Background:
The intent of this repo is to provide starter code for developers in a Hackathon to write agent applications using Mosaic AI Agent Framework on Databricks Intelligent Platform. We will use LangChain library and notebooks. 

The focus is to develop business logic and proof of concept instead of deployment patterns or scalability.

#Objective
To create an agentic application that is consistent with host business objectives that leverages the following emerging technologies
- Vector Index Retriever ()
- AI/BI Genie Api ()
- Compound AI System using LangChain
  - Tools
  - AgentExecutor
- Mosaic AI Capabilities
  - Model Serving
  - Pay Per Token Foundation Models (List the models)  
  - Model Serving 
  - AI Gateway
