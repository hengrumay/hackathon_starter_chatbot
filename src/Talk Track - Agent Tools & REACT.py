# MAGIC ###Is LLM Really Smart?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We know Large Language Models are good at tasks involving Natural Language Understanding. But as any other model, the responses of an LLM is confined to the data that was used to train the model. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's pick one of the latest models from Llama family and ask some simple questions. 

# COMMAND ----------

llm = ChatDatabricks(
    endpoint="databricks-meta-llama-3-1-405b-instruct",
    max_tokens = 100,
    temperature= 0.1)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Oops!! Looks like not
# MAGIC Or, may be that results were not surprising!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Making LLMs Smarter
# MAGIC There are various ways to make LLMs act smarter and handle complex tasks. Retrieval Augmented Generation and Agents are two mainly used techniques
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a way to supply additional context to an LLM based on the question and use NLP capabilities of LLM to generate an answer. RAG can improve the accuracy of responses by integrating external data with LLMs, which can sometimes generate false responses or generic answers. But it still does not makes the Agent capable of handling tasks that require complex reasoning, planning, and decision-making.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Agents** are applications that can make decisions and perform actions independently to achieve a goal. AI agents are good for tasks that require complex reasoning, planning, and decision-making. AI agents can interact with various systems and APIs, and can use previous data to personalize interaction
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We see that Large Language Models can only act within the knowledge with which they are trained on. But, we can enhance tha abilities of these models by providing tools that can carry out deterministic operations and prompting them to use these tools appropriately. These tools can be simple python functions or can be complex business processes.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC So, now let us provide our LLM with some simple tools
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ###Create Tools
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Tool consists of several components:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * A python function that implements the logic for the tool
# MAGIC * `name` (`str`), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent
# MAGIC * `description` (`str`), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use
# MAGIC * `args_schema` (`Pydantic BaseModel`), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this exercise, we will use LangChain library to create tools. There are several ways to create tool using LangChain. We will cover few semantics here

# MAGIC ####ReACT Framework
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The ReACT (Reasoning and Action) is a framework aimed at enhancing the capabilities of LLMs. It does this by merging two key functions: reasoning and action.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Reasoning: At its core, the model leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which can analyze complex information, draw inferences, and understand context. This enables the model to evaluate various situations and determine the best course of action based on available data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Action: In addition to reasoning, the ReACT model incorporates the ability to take concrete actions. This means that once the model has analyzed a situation, it can perform specific tasks or respond in a way that directly impacts the environment or user.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Integration: By combining these two elements, the ReACT model can not only process and understand information but also act upon it. This leads to a more sophisticated system capable of managing complex interactions, such as responding to user queries, adjusting to changing circumstances, and keeping track of ongoing scenarios.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Overall, the ReACT model represents a significant advancement in creating intelligent systems that can reason and act in a cohesive manner, making them more effective in real-world applications.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is achieved by prompting the model to decompose the question into smaller pieces and solve individually.

# MAGIC ###Agent Evaluation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Agentic applications are complex and involve many different components. Evaluating the performance of these applications is not as straightforward as evaluating the performance of traditional ML models. Both qualitative and quantitative metrics that are used to evaluate quality are inherently more complex. Agent Evaluation includes proprietary LLM judges and agent metrics to evaluate retrieval and request quality as well as overall performance metrics like latency and token cost. [Read More](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #####Evaluation Dataframe
# MAGIC To measure the quality of an agentic application, you need to define what a high-quality, accurate response looks like. To do that, you create an evaluation set, which is a set of representative questions and ground-truth answers. Read more about the structure of Evaluation Dataset [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/evaluation-set.html#evaluation-set-schema)

  ],

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation uses two approaches to evaluate the quality of an agentic application.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **LLM judges**: A separate LLM acts as a judge to evaluate the application’s retrieval and response quality. Agent Evaluation includes a suite of built-in LLM judges that make it possible to scale up the evaluation process and include a large set of test cases.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Deterministic calculations**: Assess performance by deriving deterministic metrics from the application’s trace and optionally the ground-truth recorded in the evaluation set. Examples include token count and latency metrics, or retrieval recall based on ground-truth documents.
